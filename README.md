Welcome!

This repo features a curated collection of systems administration solutions I've developed over my 20+ year career in IT.

To respect employer IP, it avoids full source code and focuses instead on problem-solving, system design, and operational insight. Each entry highlights a real-world tool or system I built -- with small illustrative snippets where helpful -- and the thinking behind it.
